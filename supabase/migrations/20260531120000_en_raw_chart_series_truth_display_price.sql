-- EN-RAW chart-series-truth: median display price + median-basis change.
--
-- PR A of the pricing-consistency rework.
--
-- Problem
-- -------
-- For EN-RAW canonical cards the hero price, the 24h/7d change, and the 7-day
-- chart were drawn from DIFFERENT bases, so they disagreed. Canonical example
-- ascended-heroes-277-pikachu-ex: hero $478.19 (PriceCharting trusted feed,
-- matched against a stale Scrydex "market" price), but the chart and change
-- come from the Scrydex DAILY SNAPSHOT series in price_history_points (latest
-- $450.69, -3.37% vs yesterday's $466.43). Three numbers, one card.
--
-- Agreed design — "the chart series is the source of truth" (EN-RAW only)
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
--   * Displayed price, change, and chart all derive from the Scrydex daily
--     snapshot series in price_history_points (the same series the chart plots
--     via public_price_history_by_printing).
--   * HERO / displayed price = a rolling 3-day MEDIAN of that daily series
--     (robust + steady), not the single latest point.
--   * CHANGE 24h/7d = computed on the SAME median basis — (3-day median now)
--     vs (3-day median ~24h ago) and (~7d ago) — so the hero and the change %
--     are internally coherent.
--   * CHART = the existing daily series (UNCHANGED).
--   * PriceCharting-as-a-source is intentionally NOT implemented here (future
--     PR). This PR uses ONLY the Scrydex snapshot series for EN-RAW.
--   * Every existing safety guard in the public view is preserved byte-for-byte:
--     raw_market_price_outlier suppression, quarantine handling, abundant /
--     low-dollar handling, and all JP / graded / non-EN paths. We change only
--     WHERE the EN-RAW headline price + change come from.
--
-- How
-- ---
-- 1. refresh_price_changes_core gains, from the SAME preferred-provider /
--    preferred-variant daily series it already builds, a daily-median CTE that
--    computes display_price (3-day median now), display_price_as_of, and the
--    median-basis 24h/7d changes, and writes them to new card_metrics columns.
--    The pre-existing change_pct_24h / change_pct_7d computation and write are
--    unchanged.
-- 2. card_metrics gains display_price / display_price_as_of /
--    display_change_pct_24h / display_change_pct_7d (ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS).
-- 3. public_card_metrics, for is_en_raw rows, reads the display_* columns for
--    public_market_price / public_change_pct_24h / public_change_pct_7d,
--    still subject to every existing guard. Because only ~703 of ~10,833
--    priced EN-RAW rows currently have a daily snapshot point in the trailing
--    3 days (the rest are tier-throttled and their chart is sparse/empty), the
--    substitution COALESCEs to the prior basis when display_price is null, so
--    cards without a chart series keep their existing headline. Cards WITH a
--    chart series now show a price/change consistent with that chart.
--
-- supersedes: 20260317093000_phase1_public_live_market_truth_followup.sql
--             (refresh_price_changes_core — latest prior body; the 2026-05-02
--              revert left _core untouched. Diffed the new body against that
--              prior body: identical CTE chain through preferred_points and
--              identical change_pct_* computation/UPDATE; this body only ADDS
--              a daily-median CTE and four display_* columns to the UPDATE,
--              widening the diff predicate accordingly. No previously-managed
--              column is dropped.)
-- supersedes: 20260528184631_trustworthy_standard_price_display.sql
--             (public_card_metrics — latest prior body. Diffed: every column,
--              CTE, guard, and code path is byte-for-byte equivalent EXCEPT the
--              three is_en_raw expressions for public_market_price /
--              public_change_pct_24h / public_change_pct_7d, which now prefer
--              the display_* columns via COALESCE. JP / graded / non-EN paths
--              and all outlier/quarantine guards are unchanged.)

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. New columns on card_metrics.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
alter table public.card_metrics
  add column if not exists display_price numeric,
  add column if not exists display_price_as_of timestamptz,
  add column if not exists display_change_pct_24h numeric,
  add column if not exists display_change_pct_7d numeric;

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. refresh_price_changes_core — extend to also compute the chart-series
--    median display price + median-basis changes.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
