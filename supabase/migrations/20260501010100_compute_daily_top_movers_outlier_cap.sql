-- 20260501010100_compute_daily_top_movers_outlier_cap.sql
--
-- Belt-and-suspenders cap on the daily_top_movers candidate pool.
--
-- Companion to 20260501010000, which fixes the source data so sparse cards
-- get NULL change_pct instead of inflated values. With NULLs at the source,
-- the existing `coalesce(...) is not null` filter in the candidates CTE
-- already excludes them. This migration adds an upper-bound |%change| cap
-- so that if refresh_price_changes is ever regressed in the future, the
-- homepage Top Movers / Biggest Drops / momentum / budget rails still
-- refuse to surface implausible double-digit / triple-digit moves.
--
-- 75% chosen as the daily-rail cap: by inspection, real-card 24h moves
-- in this catalog cluster well under 30%, and any card that moves more
-- than 75% in a day is virtually always either (a) sparse-data artifact
-- the source cap missed, or (b) a Scrydex pricing reset. Neither belongs
-- on the homepage.
--
-- All other behaviour preserved verbatim from 20260429010250
-- (premium / budget tier split, momentum_24h / momentum_7d rails,
-- coverage gate, set-diversity capping).
