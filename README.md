# PopAlpha
PopAlpha is an experimental arbitrage engine for Pokémon cards.  It compares marketplace pricing anchors, estimates net spreads after fees, and ranks opportunities by liquidity-adjusted edge.  The MVP uses prebaked data to simulate real-world conditions while maintaining a modular architecture for future API integrations.
